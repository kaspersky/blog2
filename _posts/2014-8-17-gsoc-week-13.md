Tomorrow is the official hard "pencils down" deadline, which means the GSoC programme for this year it's almost finished.

During past days I kept the forked Monkey up-to-date, so all the work during this summer could be merged into main branch with just a click. I documented everything and successfully tested the stats interface and python bindings on a Raspbian (qemu-arm) system. Additionnally, I did some performance related tests and found out that the python version of Monkey is almost as fast as the native C version.

During the programme I learned some very interesting things (there were a few painful moments battling segmentation faults). Also, I must thank Eduardo and Sonny for their continued support all these weeks. It was a truly awesome experience for me.
