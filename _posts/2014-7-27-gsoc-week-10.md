After implementing the callbacks the way I described in the last blog post, there was a persistent segmentation fault occuring while the python function was called from C code.

After some research I found out that the error happened because C code was operating on python objects, but without acquiring the [Global Interpreter Lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock). The Monkey library is just interfaced, so it's internals mechanisms are not aware of the GIL, and races occurs because monkey is a multithreaded application. Fortunately, this is [documented](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/init.html#non-python-created-threads), so the solution was to use `with gil:` in cython and call `PyEval_InitThreads` from the main thread.

With that, I was able to successfully port the examples of use of the library in `examples/` and the library test suite in `tests/lib/`, so the implementation of python bindings for the library is quite complete.

Next week I will focus on preparing the code for clean integration into master and documentation.
