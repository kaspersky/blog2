## Execution time

Last week I started to define an interface for performance counters. It offers support for:

- counting how often different functions are called
- measure the average execution time of these functions

The associated information is stored in a data structure, unique to each thread.

{% highlight c %}
struct stats
{
    long long mk_session_create_n; // number of calls
    long long mk_session_create_m; // memory
    long long mk_session_create_t; // execution time

    long long mk_session_get_n;
    long long mk_session_get_m;
    long long mk_session_get_t;

    //...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Using callgrind tool from valgrind I identified the most called functions from Monkey:

</figure>

I added counters to some of the most used routines and ran a profiling test. After running the test, the library can expose the gatheres statistics, in raw form (function times called:time spent):

    Stat info for worker: 27290
    mk_session_create 1295:762561
    mk_session_get 3863:770020
    mk_http_method_get 1273:375894
    mk_http_request_end 0:0
    mk_http_range_parse 0:0
    mk_http_init 1273:25544515
    mk_sched_get_connection 7726:1569531
    mk_sched_remove_client 1295:11829434
    mk_plugin_stage_run 6409:1273259
    mk_plugin_event_read 1295:478498
    mk_plugin_event_write 2568:704899
    mk_header_send 1273:5914529


As is seen in the call graph, `pthread_getspecific` is called a tremendous amount of times. The function represent an overhead, which can be avoided. It is used only in places where the scheduler node associated information is not accessible, to grab a pointer to the statistics data structure. The solution is to modify the monitored functions' signature and pass the scheduler node as a variable to them.


## Memory usage

The interface can also be further extended to keep track of memory allocations. Monkey already uses malloc/free wrappers, which can be modified to record the amount of memory requested per worker. The interface calls look like this:

{% highlight c %}
STATS_MEM_ALLOC(func_name, amount);
STATS_MEM_FREE(func_name);
{% endhighlight %}

The free call is a bit tricky, since the amount of freed memory is unknown. The issue can be solved by registering the pointers into a hashtable and at free to lookup the pointer and get the associated allocated memory.
