#### configure Monkey for using stats interface

This week I added a convenient configure option to Monkey which can trigger or disable the stats interface:

{% highlight bash %}
./configure --stats
{% endhighlight %}

It dezactivates the `STATS_COUNTER` family of macros, so now the interface can be used selectively, just like the debug or trace options. Also, the counters are now independent from the library.

#### pthread_getspecific

As the counters information is stored in a thread specific data structure, each time access to it is needed, `pthread_getspecific(sched_node)` is called. I decided to check the overhead, by eliminating the `pthread_getspecific` call and instead passing the scheduler node as a [function argument](https://github.com/kaspersky/monkey/commit/e79c217d4a96bf06c75ae4f7d3366f53f10ccd7c).

I usually profile Monkey using [monkey-bench](https://github.com/monkey/monkey-bench), in order to see how many requests per second it performs:

{% highlight bash %}
monkey-bench/mkbench http://localhost:2001/index.html -c 500 -t 4 -l 500 -N -r 1000000 -p PID_NR
{% endhighlight %}

Measuring the performance locally on my machine, there were ~70000 requests/second, for *both* cases, so, as a conclusion, `pthread_getspecific` does not represent an overhead.

However, when a large number of functions are traced, `clock_gettime` calls used for timing bring ~5% overhead.

#### Library configuration

I implemented an additional library routine to retrieve Monkey configuration (number of workers, index files, timeouts etc.) and a [unit test](https://github.com/kaspersky/monkey/commit/783749ec099c4b58826152dff37d686396b2364c) for it.

Also, the library did not make use of the recently added kernel features (TCP_FASTOPEN, TCP_AUTOCORKING, TCP_REUSEPORT), as it has a separate configuration step. This was fixed by adding the following to `mklib_init`:

    mk_kernel_init();
    mk_kernel_features();
